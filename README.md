This nutrition facts project imports data from unique CSV files. It compares data from popular beverages in various graphs and tables. 


The requirements I am meeting are 
“Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application”
“Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data”
“Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display”
